# 👋 Hi, I'm **J.V. Sai Kiran**

🚀 **Senior Software Engineer** with 10+ years of experience in **embedded systems, real-time C/C++ development, IoT platforms, and performance-critical system software**.

I build firmware, platform components, and distributed systems that run close to hardware — and I also love writing about what I learn.

## 🛠️ What I Work On
- Embedded firmware for constrained devices (Qualcomm SoCs: QCA4020, Snapdragon)
- Kernel/System-level development (C/C++, metadata engines, execution flows)
- Open Table Formats: **Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, Parquet**
- IoT applications — BLE services, persistent storage, fast-connect
- Distributed systems & product engineering in strong production environments
- AI-assisted engineering tools using **Agentic AI + RAG**
